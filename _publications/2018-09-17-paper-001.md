permalink: /publication/2018-09-17-paper-001
excerpt: 'This explores the integration of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in real-world testing environments. A key component discussed is the Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) which enables vehicles in a platoon to maintain appropriate spacing and speed, using vehicle-to-vehicle communication to adjust to perturbations quickly. The paper also examines the impact of Emergency Electronic Brake Light (EEBL) systems which alert drivers to hard braking incidents ahead, even when the braking vehicle is not directly in sight. These systems are tested on a VISSIM-based simulation platform, which provides a detailed microscopic traffic simulation, integrating MATLAB, Python, and C++ for robust testing of ADAS functionalities under varied driving conditions.'

UKCITE, an InnovateUK funded project, provides a test environment on a mix road network in the UK. This paper presents the simulation counterpart of the real world test environment. It uses the VISSIM microscopic traffic simulation environment together with MATLAB, python and C++ to simulate advance driver assistance systems (ADAS). Vehicle specific simulation parameters are tuned based on human factor studies carried out on driver simulator as well as published data. Driver models are implemented using the VISSIM DLL interface to replicate expected drivers responses to ADAS. Within the scope of this project, various driver-warning systems were implemented. This paper focuses on cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) and emergency electronic brake Light (EEBL). Individual vehicle behaviours were evaluated using a model of the Gaydon test track. The impact of these algorithms on the traffic was evaluated using a calibrated model of a portion of the M42 smart motorway.
