excerpt: 'This paper presents a novel approach to traffic flow forecasting that utilizes a hybrid wide and deep learning architecture. This model integrates both spatial-temporal and periodic features, aiming to enhance the predictive accuracy of traffic forecasting systems. The wide component of the model focuses on capturing periodic features, particularly the weekly patterns, shown to be most impactful, while the deep component, built on a conv-LSTM architecture, extracts spatial-temporal features. The effectiveness of this model is demonstrated through extensive experiments that compare its performance against traditional models, showing notable improvements in forecasting accuracy.'

Accurate traffic flow forecasting can improve the effectiveness of traffic management schemes, leading to reduced traffic congestions, emissions, costs, and improved health and productivity of commuters. However, the complex non-linear, periodic, and dynamic spatial-temporal nature of traffic flow data makes traffic forecasting challenging. This work proposes a deep-learning model, based on wide and deep architecture, to mine both periodic and spatial-temporal features. The wide section consists of a fully connected layer optimized to mine the periodic feature, while the deep portion consists of a conv-LSTM module, which extracts the spatial-temporal features. The network is made more efficient by analyzing traffic data periodicity and selecting the most relevant features, namely the weekly pattern. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms existing approaches whilst requiring one less input, thereby reducing the amount of pre-processing required. The evaluation of model accuracy considers the GEH statistic, used by traffic modellers, as well as traditional criteria adopted in traffic forecasting.
