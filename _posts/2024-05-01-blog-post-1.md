We like to believe we are free. Free to choose who we become. Free to make decisions without constraint. This belief in free will is one of the most deeply held assumptions in modern life.

But what if it isn’t quite true?

What if the “choices” we make aren’t really choices at all, but reactions shaped by the cultural environment we were born into? What if, rather than being the authors of our lives, we are characters following a script written long before we arrived?

This idea might feel uncomfortable, even radical. But when we step back and observe human behaviour at scale, a pattern begins to emerge—one that challenges our assumptions about freedom.

Culture: The Invisible Operating System
------
Culture is the invisible system running in the background of our societies. It defines what is considered normal, acceptable, or desirable. It informs how we work, how we relate to others, what we value, and even how we see ourselves.

Like an operating system on a computer, culture creates the boundaries within which all “programs" run. Each individual in a society is like an application on that system—expressing variations, but never operating outside the core rules set by the culture.

When we talk about work ethic, views on education, family roles, or ambition, we are talking about how people are shaped by the cultural OS they inhabit. What seems like personal choice often turns out to be predictable variation within a collective framework.

The Illusion of Free Will
------
At the individual level, it’s easy to think we’re making our own choices. But when we zoom out and observe people in groups, patterns appear. These patterns repeat across societies, time, and traits. One of the most striking of these patterns is the bell curve, also known as the normal distribution.

Whether we’re looking at academic performance, risk tolerance, or attitudes toward authority, most people cluster around a central average. A few lie further out on either side. But the shape of the curve repeats, again and again.

This is not random. It's not a coincidence. It's structure.

The Galton Board: A Simple Metaphor
------
The Galton board offers a perfect analogy. It’s a device that drops balls through a series of pins. Each ball bounces left or right on its way down, seemingly at random. But after enough balls fall, a clear and consistent bell curve forms at the bottom.

From the ball’s perspective, the path seems unpredictable. A turn left here, a bounce right there. But from the outside, a pattern always emerges. It doesn’t matter how each ball moves—the shape is already written by the structure of the board.

In this metaphor, the structure of the Galton board represents culture. The balls are individuals. We may feel we are freely bouncing through life, making choices at each junction, but the larger shape is already defined. It’s the system—not the ball—that determines the outcome.

Beyond Culture
------
While culture is the central force, it doesn’t work alone. Environment and economic structures also shape outcomes. But even these are not separate from culture. A culture that values academic achievement will create different economic and educational environments than one that doesn’t.

So while many factors affect our behavior, culture is the foundation. It defines our limits and sets our expectations. It determines what feels normal and what feels impossible. And most of the time, we never even realise it’s there.

The Takeaway
------
We live our lives feeling like free agents, charting our own paths. But when we step back, we see the same curve forming, again and again. Culture shapes the average. The average shapes behaviour. And most of us live close to that center.

Free will may exist in some limited sense, but its scope is far narrower than we like to believe. More often than not, we are fulfilling the conditions of the system we were born into.

We aren’t choosing as freely as we think. We’re playing out roles written by the culture we never chose.
